          To us innovation means: Seeing the bigger picture, striving for better
          insights, always curious, thinking the unthinkable, the impossible and
          then making it happen. In other words, we support our customers with
          the business and technology know-how they need to continuously improve
          and gain new advantages to win now and in the future.
